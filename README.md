SQL Hospital Data Analysis 🏥💡
I recently completed an SQL assignment provided by Satisha Dhawale, where I worked on extracting key insights from a hospital dataset using SQL queries. This project helped me improve my data querying and analysis skills while answering critical business questions.

🔍 Key Insights Extracted:
✔️ Total number of patients per hospital
✔️ Average number of doctors per hospital
✔️ Top departments with the highest patient count
✔️ Hospital with the maximum medical expenses
✔️ Daily average medical expenses
✔️ Longest patient stay duration
✔️ Patient distribution across cities
✔️ Department-wise average patient stay
✔️ Department with the least number of patients
✔️ Monthly total medical expenses
